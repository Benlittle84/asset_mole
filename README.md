## How to run the test suite

Rspec is the unit testing framework installed in this project. Tests are executed in the default rake
task, and it is recommended that you run this default rake task as in future further checks may be
added to it.

```bash
bundle exec rake
```
However if you wish to run just the rspec tests locally you may:

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/                   # Run everything within the spec directory
bundle exec rspec spec/my_test_spec.rb:4  # Run test at line 4 of specific test

```
